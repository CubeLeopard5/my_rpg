Hi! I'm the professor Coke, I've been waiting for you. You travaled to a paralled universe. Here, it's not like in your universe, it's the pokemon that train humans. Or maybe it's just happening in your head because you're high again, who know? Anyway you need to find the great Otaria to go back to your world. I gave you a human to fight.        Go next a someone a press "enter" to interact with him.
